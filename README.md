## Advanced Lane Finding
![Lanes Image](./examples/example_output.jpg)

In this project, your goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video, but the main output or product we want you to create is a detailed writeup of the project.  Check out the [writeup template](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup_template.md) for this project and use it as a starting point for creating your own writeup.  

### Instructions

The project is written in `Python` using `Jupyter Notebook`. 

The projects incudes various pipeline steps as describe in `Project_Writeup`.

Please refer to `Advanced_Lane_Detection.ipynb` for the code. This file is self explainatory which walks you through every step with visualization of output images at every step.

The test images for the pipeline are stored in the folder `test_images` and the output images after every pipeline step are stored in `output_images` folder.

The final pipeline is run on the `project_video` and the new processed video is created named `output_project_Video`.
